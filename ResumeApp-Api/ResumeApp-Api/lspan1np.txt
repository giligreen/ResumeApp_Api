Dreams:
This is a story about a woman named Aviah. Once, Aviah dreamed about her grandmother who died already. In the dream, her grandmother was very weak and with an angry face. Aviah wanted her grandmother to feel better so she gave her a plate of soup, but her grandmother denied it vigorously. Aviah thought what could be the reason for her grandmother's angry face. Then she remembered that in the past she used to cover her hair, and now she barely does. Because of the dream she decided to start covering her hair again as she did in the past, to be a Zechut for her grandmother. After a while, she dreamed again about her grandmother, and this time, she was smiling and hugged Aviah strongly!
